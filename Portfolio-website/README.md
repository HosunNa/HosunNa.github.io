# How I created web portfolio?
When I pushed my web portfolio html to the github, it could not find my website. I waited for a while, and then, I figured out why I could not see my website. The reason is that I typed Index.html instead of index.html, so I had to delete the original one and re-make the correct name of file on the visual studio. While I was making web portfolio site, I faced some of problem. I only used 'font-size:__px' or 'width:__px / height:__px' when I adjusted the size of font or images. However, when I used 'px', the font was the same size even at the tablet or web version, so I needed the other code to fix this problem. The solution was 'vw'. For example, my mobile version of width size is 376. To find the correct vaule of 'vw', I had to calculate the number of pixel divide by 376 (which is mobile size) multiply 100. I still did not clear why I have to time 100, but I could solve the problem. Also, I tried to make an image inside of an outline of circle.
I wanted to make a hambuger menu which is located on the header. I searched the method of creating the menu cord on the Internet. Therefore, I tried to apply to my website. Consequentially, it is not perfect but it's created and applied on my header.
I wanted to use flex and grid to arrange photos but I could not apply the cord.I need to study the method of using grid and flex.
